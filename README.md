# The Cloud Resume Challenge
This is still a work in progress, but it is nearly in a state that feels presentable, and you can check out how it looks right now at https://jmkriz.dev!

This is the backend for my implementation of Forrest Brazeal's [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/). The challenge is to create a static website hosted serverlessly in the cloud which displays the contents of my resume along with a visitor count.

The frontend of this site is written using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the backend is written in Python. Everything is hosted on AWS, and any changes are automatically tested via GitHub Actions and deployed via Terraform.
